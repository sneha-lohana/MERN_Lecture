In this project we are going to use the Github API to load the user data,
and search for users.

URL : https://api.github.com/
in this we will use: https://api.github.com/search/users?q={query}{&page,per_page,sort,order}
here query -> username 
page -> which page
per_page -> users per page

1. Create a new react project by the name github-cards
2. Install react extension in visual code studio.
3. Create the project structure as:
-> index.js
-> App.js
-> CardList.js -> use shortcut rfc to create React Function Component.
-> Card.js

4. Execute the code and check.

********** Working on Card ************

Whenever you are working on project, you should divide the project into 
multiple components. We have done that. Now when you start development 
you need to ensure to work on the smallest component first.
Why? You will be able to derive the parent, So that the flow can be 
easily decided. Child component is not dependent on data, it should focus 
on displaying data that is provided by the parent component.

Initially you can start with hardcoded data, then you can implement
dynamic content gradually. Always do reverse engineering, because 
that will allow to have clarity and a sense of acheivement. Because you 
will be able to see the progress.

-> from the api -> we will copy 2 users data into array of users. check testData
-> from the copied data we shall keep only login, id, avatar_url and html_url
-> Create a const profile with single value to design the card.
-> Add the below code:
export default function Card() {
  // loading 1st data
  const profile = testData[0];
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={profile.avatar_url} alt={profile.login}/>
      <div>{profile.login}</div>
      <a href={profile.html_url} target='_blank'>Github Link</a>
    </div>
  )
}
-> you will get a warning, to avoid warning add rel="noreferrer" this is for 
security purposes.

		**** Adding Styling to the Card ****
You can do it using inline style or external style:

1. Inline Styling:
style is a JSX expression so we need to create an object of style. So we will have
double { {} } curly brackets.
Outer  {} is for JSX expression and inner {} is for object of style
<img src={profile.avatar_url} alt={profile.login} style={ {width:'150px', borderRadius: '50%'} }/>

2. External Styling:
-> Add Card.css file
-> We need to add class name to the main div. as class is a keyword we will use
className=value in JSX
<div className='profile-info'>

-> Now perform the CSS creation in inspect:
display: flex;
gap: 10px;
margin: 0.5 rem;
border: 1px solid grey;
padding: 0.25 rem;
border-radius: 4px;

-> Now add this to Card.css
.profile-info{
    display: flex;
    gap: 10px;
	margin: 0.5rem;
	border: 1px solid grey;
	padding: 0.25rem;
	border-radius: 4px;
}
-> import Card.css in Card.js
import './Card.css';

-> Now let add another div to keep the User name and git.
<div>
	<div>{profile.login}</div>
	<a href={profile.html_url} target='_blank' rel="noreferrer">Github Link</a>
</div>

********** Working on CardList **********
-> As we have understood that the Child will not have data, it will display
the data that is given by the Parent component. Therefore we will remove the 
testData variable from Card.js and move it to CardList.js
-> Now the data can be passes as properties to the Card Component from CardList.
	**Card.js
export default function Card(props) {
  // loading 1st data
  const profile = props.profile;
	**CardList.js
export default function CardList() {
  return (
    <>
        <Card profile={testData[0]} />
        <Card profile={testData[1]} />
    </>
  )
}
Now execute and check the data is updated.

	**** Creation of mock up file for testData ********
please understand the orginal data will be coming from an API and for
that the data will have to be moved out of CardList to it Parent. 
Therefore, we will create a json file for the test data.
-> create test-data.json file and copy the array into the file
-> Now import test-data.json into CardList.js
import testData from './test-data.json';

Now lets check in how many ways the data can be shared from CardList to Card:
1st Way using the property name profile:
** CardList.js ***
 <Card profile={testData[0]} />
** Card.js **
console.log(props);

2nd way using the spread operator while sharing the data as property:
** CardList.js ***
<Card {...testData[0]} />

So when you see the console you will see keys are properties in the output.
This is commonly used by many coders.

** Card.js ***
const profile = props;

** Now we will display multiple values in the cards. **
So how do we create loop in JSX. We can't write for loop directly in JSX.

Lets add the profiles from json file into a variable:
const profiles = testData;

now using map function we will loop the data.
{profiles.map(profile => {
          return <Card {...profile} />
        })}
		
** Now you will see that there is an error, now lets see how to solve the error.
and what is the error.

Each child should have a unique key prop. => meaning the json data can work on filter
That is possible with the help of unique key values
So now how can we solve this problem, is by using map function there is return value index.
That will be re utilized to be passed as key in the Card component

{profiles.map((profile, index) => {
          return <Card {...profile} key={index} />
        })}

** Now lets install chrome extension React Developer Tools
Restart chrome and check inspect, in the additional options select components
so you can check the key

Current we have used the index as the unique key but ideal situation will be use
a unique value in the key, for eg we can use the id from the git api data for the same

{profiles.map(profile => {
          return <Card {...profile} key={profile.id} />
        })}
		
*********** Now we will create pagination for our profiles ************
1. Lets add 2 buttons and their respective functions in CardList.js:
  const onPrev = () => {}
  const onNext = () => {}

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={onPrev}>Prev</button>
      <button onClick={onNext}>Next</button>
	  
2. Now lets paginate the sheet with the help of slice function on the json data.

  export default function CardList() {
  let start = 0;
  let end = 3;
  let profiles = testData.slice(start, end);
  // const profiles = testData;

  const onPrev = () => {}
  const onNext = () => {
    start = 3; 
    end = 6;
    profiles = testData.slice(start, end);
  };

  console.log("rendering");

So with this you will observe single page is loaded but next page is not modified
This is due to virtual DOM. So now we will have to modify the code and use
useState.

let [profiles, setProfile] = useState(testData.slice(start, end));
  // const profiles = testData;

  const onPrev = () => {}
  const onNext = () => {
    start = 3; 
    end = 6;
    setProfile(testData.slice(start, end));
  };
  
 Now in the above code we have done basic coding and the values are hard coded 
 thats why the data is changing for 6 records in total.
 
 ** Now lets make this dynamic
 Lets say we have 11 records in total.
 Page Size - or number of records per Page is 3.
 We also need pagenumbers
 We will have to make the calculations of the start and end values:
 
 pagenumber - 0
 start = 0
 end = 3

pagenumber - 1
start = 3
end = 6

pagenumber - 2
start = 6
end = 9

pagenumber - 3
start = 9
end = 11

Explain slice function rule.

formula will be 
end = start + pageSize
start = pagenumber * pagesize

Now lets implement the above understaning into code.
So below code will be added into CardList.js

1st remove all the unwanted code.
and add variables pageSize and pagenumber and necessary code as below"
export default function CardList() {
  const pageSize = 3;
  let pageNumber = 0; 
  let [profiles, setProfile] = useState(testData.slice(0, pageSize));
  
  const onPrev = () => {}
  const onNext = () => {
	pageNumber +=1;
    const start = pageNumber * pageSize; 
    const end = start + pageSize;
    setProfile(testData.slice(start, end));
  };
	
2nd now execute and check what is the issue.
We observe the next button works only one time.
now lets check the senario by adding the log

pageNumber +=1;
console.log(pageNumber);

Execute the code and check what happens?
Why pageNumber is showing 1 everytime we click on Next button?

What is the issue?

PageNumber is a normal variable which is not stored in the state.
Therfore when setProfile is executed the PageNUmber is reset to zero.

What should we do to get the updated pageNumber value.

1. you may say we can make the pageNumber a global variable but if suppose 
there is another Component that is using pageNumber and modifies the 
pageNumber to 10 then Next button will behave weirdly. It will directly 
show 10th Page instead of zero.

The solution is using useState.
const [pageNumber, setPageNumber] = useState(0);
setPageNumber(pageNumber+1);

Lets also add the code for onPrev function: we just modify + to -
const onPrev = () => {
    setPageNumber(pageNumber-1);
    console.log(pageNumber);
    const start = pageNumber * pageSize; 
    const end = start + pageSize;
    setProfile(testData.slice(start, end));
  };

NOw lets execute and check do we get the output as per need or 
we still have any issues.
If you observe on load we have the pageNumber zero rendered twice and 
when clicked on prev button we get blank values.

Any guess why?

This is because the useState 1st updates the DOM and then calls 
the setPageNumber function.

So the solution is we can use a different hook - useRef which means
use Reference, it creates a mutable reference object which doesn't have 
a update function on value. 1st lets see what gets displayed in the 
pageNumber.

Add below code and comment useState, setPageNumber function call in onNext and
onPrev

const pageNumber = useRef(0);
console.log("rendering", pageNumber);

So u see we get an object with current key wit value zero

Now the question is how will we assign the values the to PageNumber using
useRef.

So we will assign the value simply to current as shown below.
pageNumber.current -=1; in onPrev
pageNumber.current +=1; in onNext

NOw everywhere u need to change pageNumber to pageNumber.current for
calculating start and end.

const start = pageNumber.current * pageSize; 

What exactly is useRef doing? it will update the state but wont rerender the
component.

**** Optimize your code. remove repeatative code ****
Add the below arrow function 

const changeProfiles = () => {
    const start = pageNumber.current * pageSize; 
    const end = start + pageSize;
    setProfile(testData.slice(start, end));
  }
  
remove the 3 lines of the code from onPrev and onNext and add function call
changeProfiles();

What is the difference between useState and useRef? (INTERVIEW Q)

useRef hook will not re-render the component if you change the value,
whereas useState will re-render the component once value of the state changes
useRef will update the state value immediately
useState will update the state value immediately, 
but we get the value of the state on next render of component

You can work on disabling the Prev and Next button with logic -- assignment.

*************** Now we will implement filtering or searching *******************
To understand searching easily we will make a copy if CardList and remove
pagination code from it. We will only keep profiles and keep full userData
instead of sliced data.

-- check

So now we will need SearchUser component. Add a new file SearchUser.js
rfc + tab - for component creation

Now in App.js above CardList we will invoke the SearchUser. 

-- check

As the rule says all the data should be passed from the parent 
component we need to move profiles to App.js

Move the let [profiles] from CardList.js to App.js and modify it as follows
let [profiles, setProfile] = useState(testData);

Add profiles to CarList component properties
<CardList profiles={profiles}/>

in CardList.js add destructuring of properties
export default function CardList({profiles}) {

*** For searching any element we need search form ***
Add the form element into the SearchUser.js 

export default function SearchUser() {
  return (
    <form>
        <input type='text'/>
        <button>Search</button>
    </form>
  )
}

Here we have a challenge, that is the page gets refreshed everytime you 
click the button. thats the default attribute of the HTML form.

We will add handleSubmit function in the form.

const handleSubmit = () => {
        console.log("handle submit");
    }
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>

Use preserve log to check that the log handle submit will be visible.

But what is the understanding, The page is getting refreshed. We 
are losing the meaning of the ReactJs single page application.
The main use is without submitting the data must be refreshed.

What to do to stop the default behaviour of HTML element? We have seen 
this in JavaScript events lecture.

We use preventDefault function.

So when we handle an event the 1st parameter we get is the event.

const handleSubmit = (event) => {
        console.log(event);
    }
	
-- check

SyntheticBasedEvent is an React object. It is like a wrapper or a parent event 
for all the events in HTML.

const handleSubmit = (event) => {
        console.log(event);
        event.preventDefault();
    }
	
-- check

So you will see the text box value is not refreshed. That means the default 
behaviour has been disabled.

Now the question is how we will get the input button value for further
usage.

We can get it using useRef hook and useState hook, we will see both the 
ways.

******* USEREF Hook ***********

const username = useRef(" ");
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input type='text' ref={username}/>
        <button>Search</button>
    </form>
  )

ALso add console.log in the handleSubmit function.
console.log(username)

-- check
now add

console.log(username.current.value)

Now we have the following problems
1. If we initialize username with a value that wont be visible
const username = useRef("Sneha");

-- check

2. If the form is small with one or 2 elements useRef hook is good 
to use, but if there are more values then we will have to create 
multiple variables which is not a right way of usage. 
Here useRef is acting similar to document.getElementByID()

********** SOLUTION **************
UseState Hook

const [username, setUserName] = useState("");
        <input type='text' value={username}/>

-- check

1. You will get a warning -- read

const [username, setUserName] = useState("Sneha");
-- check

2. try changing the value it wont change.
the reason is this is an uncontrolled element

** WHat is a controlled and uncontrolled element?
Uncontrolled elements are HTML elements. Anything that is not
directly controlled by ReactJs are called uncontrolled.

this is cz of the warning - now the solution is in the warning
itself, add an onChnage event.

<input type='text' value={username} onChange={handleChange}/>
const handleChange = (event) => {}

-- check
now try refreshing and updating the value.

the value is not getting updated.

const handleChange = (event) => {
    console.log(event.target.value);
}

-- check

NOw you will see the data is getting updated but its not updated
in input element.

WHY is this happening?

We are invoking onChange event we are printing the updated value.
But in the input the value property is not changed.

add log(render) inside the component

-- check

Component is not re-rendered as the State is not updated.

const handleChange = (event) => {
    setUserName(event.target.value);
    console.log(event.target.value);
  }

-- check (tell importance of render log)

Now the data is getting updated
** Now we need to pass the input value from SearchUser to App
so that the profiles can be updated.

So as we have seen we can define the function and pass it as a
property into the JSX

**App.js
  const searchUsers = (username) => {
    console.log(username);
  }
  
      <SearchUser onSearch={searchUsers}/>
**SearchUser.js
export default function SearchUser(props) {
  ...
    event.preventDefault();
    props.onSearch(username);
 }
-- check
The searched data will be passed from CHild to Parent
and username will be displayed

Now we apply filter function.

const searchUsers = (username) => {
    console.log(username);
    const users = testData.filter(profile => {
      return profile.login.includes(username);
    });
    setProfile(users);
  }
  
-- check
the above code is case sensitive. to remove the case sensitivity
add tolowerCase.

return profile.login.toLowerCase().includes(username.toLowerCase());

-- check

**********************************************
Now understanding accessiblity of files:
Anything in src is not accessible thru url:
http://localhost:3000/test-data.json

http://localhost:3000/logo512.png	

Public files will be accessible not src.

For API call understanding lets move test-data.json to public folder
http://localhost:3000/test-data.json

Now the data will be visible.

Now lets call the api using the fetch function.
fetch function is a promise.

function fetctUsers(){
  fetch("http://localhost:3000/test-data.json")
  .then(res => res.json()) 
  .then(data => console.log(data))
}

fetctUsers();

--- check

Error will be visible
remove import of userData
and replace the variable with empty array []

let [profiles, setProfile] = useState([]);

  const searchUsers = (username) => {
    console.log(username);
    const users = [].filter(profile => {

-- check 

also remove initialized username from SearchUser.js

const [username, setUserName] = useState("");

-- check

Now add the fetctUsers function code inside the App component

then in the fetctUsers function add the code.
.then(data => setProfiles(data))

-- check

Now if you observe there is a problem:
1. If you observe network the json is called multiple times
as if it is a infinte loop

Lets comment the fetctUsers code.

Why is it going into infinte user? Remember the render component.

explain the useState effect.
This is called the SideEffect.

**** SOLUTION *****

useEffect Hook

useEffect(()=> {
    fetch("http://localhost:3000/test-data.json")
    .then(res => res.json()) 
    .then(data => setProfiles(data))
  })
  
-- check

Even after this the code is going into infinte loop

useEffect has 2nd parameter has [state, props].
default value is [state, props] which means in every change invoke
the useEffect. SO add empty array []

useEffect(()=> {
    fetch("http://localhost:3000/test-data.json")
    .then(res => res.json()) 
    .then(data => setProfiles(data))
  }, [])
  
-- check
