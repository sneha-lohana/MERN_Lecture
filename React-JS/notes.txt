React JS is a library or a framework?
-> React is a library. React website tells us it a library. https://react.dev/

What is the difference between library and framework?

**Library**
-> Library is a collection of functions or API or API functions. 
-> It helps us in reducing writing of code. It provides utility or helper function
-> JQuery is also a library that we can use how ever we want. 
-> You can create your own structure or functions
-> We are the driving factor for library
-> library is lite weight, small websites, web applications (mid level applications)

**Framework**
-> Framework has a fixed structure
-> Framework is the driving factor as how to use the code
-> We have to follow the structure
-> Enterprise and major applications use Framework
-> folder structure and other aspects.

ReactJS is more popular that Angular.

https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project
React website says "If you want to build a new app or a new website fully with React, we recommend picking one of the React-powered frameworks popular in the community."

Database connectivity is not supported in React. We can use fetch function to call Database.

React JS is front end, that calls only the API. There is no dependency between frontend and backend.

Angular is also ment for front end. We cacn't connect Angular or React.

Lets create our first React App:
index1.html

**React Installation**
We have 2 ways to install react:
** Way 1:

Goto https://react.dev/learn/installation > Goto Try React locally and copy the script from the HTML.

<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

** Way 2:
-> first Install Node JS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/current
-> Download the LTS version and install
-> Open CMD > node -v > if you are getting the version the installation of node is successful.
-> Now and install react and react-dom through CMD > npm install react react-dom
-> Now add the path of react-development.js and react-dom.development.js into script src.

React is a component based library. Any task that needs to be performed is supposed to be performed in form of a component.

Easiest way to connect is all HTML elements are simulations to React components.

components should be small so that we can easily maintain them.

components can be created in 2 ways:
1. Function based component
2. Class based component
